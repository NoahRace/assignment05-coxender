In this assignment, there are a few .java files (i.e., source code files with Java statements). These Java files have errors in them. What you need to do is:

For each Java file,
1. write down the compiler's error message in a comment in the beginning of the Java file
2. fix those errors 
3. explain what the errors are and how you fixed them
4. upload the new fixed ```.java``` files (keep the original filenames; do not change the filenames)
